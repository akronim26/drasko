## Discord Bot Setup

2. Click "New Application"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "TradeBot")
4. Go to the "Bot" section
5. Click "Add Bot"
6. Copy the bot token (you'll need this for `DISCORD_API_TOKEN`)
7. Copy the Application ID (you'll need this for `DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID`)

### 2. Configure Bot Permissions

In the Discord Developer Portal:

1. Go to "OAuth2" â†’ "URL Generator"
2. Select scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`
3. Select bot permissions:
   - Read Messages/View Channels
   - Send Messages
   - Use Slash Commands
   - Read Message History
4. Copy the generated URL and use it to invite the bot to your server

### 3. Test Discord Integration

```bash
npm run test:discord
```

This will verify your Discord configuration and test message processing.

## Getting API Keys

### Gemini API Key (Primary - Recommended)
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the API key and add it to your `.env` file as `GEMINI_API_KEY`

**Note**: Gemini API has a generous free tier (15 requests per minute, 1500 requests per day), making it perfect for development and testing.

### OpenAI API Key (Optional - Fallback)

2. Sign in and create a new API key
3. Add it to your `.env` file as `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Usage

### Starting the Discord Trading Bot (Recommended)

```bash
npm start
```

This starts the full ElizaOS bot with Discord integration enabled. The bot will:
- Connect to Discord and monitor channels
- Analyze crypto-related messages for sentiment
- Generate trading signals and respond with formatted messages
- Provide real-time market analysis

### Starting the Simplified Trading Bot (Console Only)

```bash
npm run start:simple
```

This bypasses the complex ElizaOS initialization and provides a fast, interactive trading bot for console use.

# Test Discord integration
npm run test:discord

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the simplified bot
npm run start:simple

# Start the full ElizaOS bot with Discord
npm start
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Missing required environment variables"**
   - Make sure you have a `.env` file with all required API keys
   - Check `DISCORD_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions

2. **Bot not responding in Discord**
   - Check that the bot token is correct
   - Verify the bot has proper permissions
   - Ensure the bot is online in Discord
   - Test with `npm run test:discord`

3. **"Bot stuck on initialization"**
   - Use the simplified version: `npm run start:simple`
   - This bypasses complex ElizaOS initialization

4. **API Rate Limits**
   - Gemini API has generous limits (15 req/min, 1500 req/day)
   - If you hit Gemini limits, the bot will fall back to OpenAI
   - OpenAI has rate limits based on your plan

### Discord-Specific Issues

1. **Bot not joining channels**
   - Check bot permissions in Discord
   - Verify the bot was invited with proper scopes
   - Ensure the bot role has channel access

2. **No trading signals in Discord**
   - Make sure messages contain crypto-related content
   - Check that the sentiment score threshold is met (0.5)
   - Verify API keys are working

## Security Notes

- Never share your bot tokens publicly
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- The bot only analyzes messages, it doesn't execute trades
- All responses include disclaimers about financial advice
- Discord bot tokens should be kept secure
